** Topic Modeling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)

- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA): This technique can uncover the underlying themes or topics discussed in each episode. You can track how topics evolve across multiple episodes.
- Dynamic Topic Modeling: A time series-based approach to LDA that tracks the evolution of topics across episodes.

** Clustering of similar episodes

- Use techniques like k-means clustering or hierarchical clustering to group episodes with similar topics or semantic content.
