# Features NOT to do

- After a startup that creates the search index but doesn't fill it for some reason, currently, a startup sees the 
  index and doesn't question its completeness. We need to implement a check that verifies the index's completeness 
  and triggers a reindex if necessary.  
  - > Too much work for a very edge case. We can live with that.
